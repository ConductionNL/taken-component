Taken Component / TC
-------

The Tasks Component offers the generic possibility to register tasks from one resource on another resource (for example Common Ground resources). This functionality is deliberately set up abstract. In the most common form, for example, an employee or user (resource) will have a task on a business or order (resource), but in abstract form a citizen (BRP resource) can also have a task or even applications or processes (as included in the PC) have a task. In this sense, the Tasks Component gives substance to tasks as well as the agenda calendar concept “todo” and the bpmn concept “task”. However, both the subject of the task and the performer of the task must be identifiable by a URL.

This means that there is automatic support for simple fulfillment flows, for example tasks could be assigned to a "User Group" and then picked up by a user in that group.

Memos are in principle seen as internal to the organization, and are emphatically not a communication channel with the customer (contact moments are available for this).
